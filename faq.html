                  <strong>What is harassment?</strong> Harassment (also known as
                  cyber harassment) is the use of email, instant messaging, and
                  websites to bully or harass an individual or group through
                  personal attacks. Harassment can be in the form of derogatory
                  or insulting comments made in chat rooms, e-mail, block
                  postings or comments on social networking sites. Those
                  responsible for harassment are often difficult to track as the
                  perpetrator is often anonymous. Harassment is very difficult
                  to verify because we often do not understand the history or
                  context of the situation. For purposes of this FAQ, consider
                  harassment to include communication between adults.

                  <strong>What is cyberbullying?</strong> Like bullying in
                  person, cyberbullying (also known as online bullying) is
                  repeated, deliberate behavior intended to tease, demean, or
                  harass someone in a less powerful position. By contrast,
                  cyberbullying uses electronic media and information technology
                  as the means for carrying out the harassment. Since
                  cyberbullying is online, it exposes the victim to harm 24
                  hours a day, can be made anonymously, and can potentially be
                  broadcast to a far wider audience than in-person attacks.
                  Cyberbullies can use any type of Internet-connected device
                  through web services like text and instant messaging, games,
                  or social media such as Facebook and Tumblr.

                  <strong>What is Cyberstalking?</strong>Cyberstalking is a
                  crime committed when someone uses the internet and other
                  technologies to harass or stalk another person online. Even
                  though cyberstalking is a broad term for online harassment, it
                  can include defamation, false accusations, teasing, and even
                  extreme threats. Often these connections will not end even
                  though the receiver requests the person to stop. The content
                  addressed at the target is frequently improper and, at times,
                  disturbing, leaving the individual beginning to feel fear.

                  isn’t a crime. Those actions usually don’t involve harassment
                  or other criminal activity. In contrast, cyberstalking can be
                  a serious crime with legal implications that may even result
                  in prison time.

                  <strong>How serious is cyberstalking?</strong>The severity of
                  a cyberstalking case depends on how far the cyberstalker has
                  gone to harass the victim. For example, posting a mean comment
                  on social media isn’t the right thing to do, but it's not a
                  crime when it doesn’t threaten the person. However, if the
                  comment does threaten the person or the cyberstalker is making
                  plans to escalate their actions, this is a more serious crime
                  on par with threatening someone in person.
